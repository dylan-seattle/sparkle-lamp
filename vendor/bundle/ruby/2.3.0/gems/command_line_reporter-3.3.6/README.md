## Command Line Reporter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wbailey/command_line_reporter.png)](https://travis-ci.org/wbailey/command_line_reporter)  [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/wbailey/command_line_reporter.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/wbailey/command_line_reporter) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/command_line_reporter.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/command_line_reporter)

This gem provides a DSL that makes it easy to write reports of various types in ruby.  It eliminates
the need to litter your source with *puts* statements, instead providing a more readable, expressive
interface to your application.  Some of the best features include:

* Formatters that automatically indicate progress
* Table syntax similar to HTML that makes it trivial to format your data in rows and columns
* Easily created headers and footers for your report
* Output suppression that makes it easy for your script to support a _quiet_ flag
* Capture report output as a string

The latest release, thanks to a contribution from [Josh Brown](https://github.com/tobijb), allows you
to choose between UTF8 or ASCII for drawing tables.  By default it will use UTF8 if your system
supports it. Here is an example of output you can generate easily with "the reporter":

* _header(hash)_ and _footer(hash)_
  * _:title_ - The title text for the section.  _Default: 'Report'_

  * _:align_ - 'left'|'right'|'center' align the title text.  _Default: 'left'_
