# SparkleFormation

Orchestration template building tools for Ruby.

## What's it do?

Provides a very loose DSL to describe orchestration API templates
programmatically in Ruby.

## Is that it?

Yes. Well, kinda. It also has some extra features, like defining
building blocks to facilitate code reuse in template creation,
helper functions for commonly generated data structures, builtin
logic for handling template nesting, and most importantly:
conjouring magic (to get unicorns).

## Using SparkleFormation

SparkleFormation is a library and not intended for "direct use". If
you are looking to build infrastructure stacks via orchestration APIs
using SparkleFormation templates, please see the reference application
